				<h1>Vanishing Point</h1>
				<h5>The mind is a wonderful thing, isn't it?</h5>
				Vanishing Point is an action stealth puzzle game that brings fringe science to life. The player will have to master supernatural abilities like forced perspective, gravity shift, and non combative stealth to solve mind-boggling puzzles. Using these abilities the player will explore the mysterious halls of Meadow Hills.

Vanishing Point follows Rose, a mentally ill patient at Meadow Hills Hospital. She enlists the help of three doctors at the institute to help cure her bizarre and misunderstood condition. While navigating the halls of Meadow Hills, Rose discovers that the doctors are helping her to control what was once her disability and turning them into powers in ways she has never imagined.

Games are cultural products, and are influenced by, and influence the society that they come from. As a game dealing with mental and neurological illnesses, we want to create something socially positive and disruptive of problematic tropes and depictions of non-normative mental conditions in popular media. We are cognizant that we can unintentionally create something harmful with this project, and will take measures to review our direction and do some good for the world.
